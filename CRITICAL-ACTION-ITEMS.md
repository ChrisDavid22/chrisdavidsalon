## 🚨 DO THESE RIGHT NOW (In Order)

### 1. FIX DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW ⏱️ 2 minutes
**PROBLEM**: No deploy.sh in root directory causes confusion

**SOLUTION**: Create wrapper script in root
```bash
# Create this file as ./deploy.sh (in root, not in 01-WEBSITE)
#!/bin/bash
echo "🚀 Deploying Chris David Salon..."
cd 01-WEBSITE && ./deploy.sh "$@"
```

**COMMANDS TO RUN**:
```bash
# From root directory:
cat > deploy.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "🚀 Deploying Chris David Salon..."
cd 01-WEBSITE && ./deploy.sh "$@"
EOF

chmod +x deploy.sh

# Test it:
./deploy.sh "Added root deploy wrapper script"
```

## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

1. **DON'T** edit files outside `/01-WEBSITE/` - they won't deploy
2. **DON'T** manually edit version.json - use deploy.sh
3. **DON'T** push directly to git - use deploy.sh
4. **DON'T** skip tests - 68% mobile users depend on it
5. **DON'T** add fake data - all metrics must be real
