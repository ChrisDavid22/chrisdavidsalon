## üìã STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Add Domain to Vercel (5 minutes)

1. **Open Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Sign in with your account

2. **Find Your Project**
   - Look for "chris-david-salon" project
   - Click on it

3. **Add Your Domain**
   - Click "Settings" tab at top
   - Click "Domains" in left sidebar
   - Click "Add Domain" button
   - Type: `chrisdavidsalon.com`
   - Click "Add"

4. **Vercel Shows You 2 Things** (IMPORTANT - WRITE THESE DOWN!)
   - An IP address (looks like: 76.76.21.21)
   - A CNAME value (looks like: cname.vercel-dns.com)

---

### Step 2: Remove Squarespace Connection (2 minutes)

1. **Log into GoDaddy**
   - Go to: https://godaddy.com
   - Sign in to your account

2. **Find Your Domain**
   - Click "My Products"
   - Find "chrisdavidsalon.com"
   - Click "DNS" button

3. **Remove Squarespace Records**
   - Look for any records pointing to Squarespace
   - These usually say "squarespace.com" or have Squarespace IPs
   - Click the trash icon to delete them
   - **Don't worry** - this just disconnects from Squarespace

---

### Step 3: Connect to Vercel (8 minutes)

**Still in GoDaddy DNS page:**

1. **Add the "A" Record** (this connects your domain)
   - Click "Add"
   - Type: A
   - Host: @ 
   - Points to: [The IP address Vercel showed you]
   - TTL: 1 hour
   - Click "Save"

2. **Add the "CNAME" Record** (this handles www)
   - Click "Add"
   - Type: CNAME
   - Host: www
   - Points to: [The CNAME Vercel showed you]
   - TTL: 1 hour
   - Click "Save"

3. **Remove Any Forwarding**
   - Look for "Forwarding" section
   - If anything is there, remove it
   - We want direct connection, not forwarding

## ‚úÖ YOU'RE DONE!

- Your domain IS the website
- SEO credit goes to YOU!
