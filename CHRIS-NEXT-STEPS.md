# üöÄ CHRIS - IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

## ‚úÖ THE FIX IS PUSHED!

I've just fixed the deployment issue. The problem was Vercel couldn't find your files.

## What Chris Needs to Do NOW (2 minutes):

### Option 1: Automatic Redeploy (Easiest)
1. **Go to your Vercel Dashboard**
2. **Click on your project** (chrisdavidsalon)
3. Vercel should already be redeploying automatically (look for spinning icon)
4. **Wait 1-2 minutes**
5. **Click "Visit"** - Should see the website!

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy (If Automatic Didn't Work)
1. **In your Vercel project**
2. **Click the 3 dots** (...) next to "Visit" button
3. **Click "Redeploy"**
4. **Select "Redeploy with existing Build Cache"**
5. **Wait 1-2 minutes**
6. **Click "Visit"** - Should see the website!

## üéØ TO VERIFY IT WORKED:

When you click "Visit" you should see:
- **Chris David Salon** logo at top
- **"DELRAY BEACH'S PREMIER HAIR SALON"** headline
- **Phone number**: (561) 299-0950
- **Book Now** button

If you see this - SUCCESS! üéâ

## üåê NEXT: ADD YOUR DOMAIN (5 minutes)

Once the website is showing correctly at chrisdavidsalon.vercel.app:

1. **In Vercel Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains**
2. **Type**: chrisdavidsalon.com
3. **Click "Add"**
4. **Screenshot the DNS settings shown**

Vercel will show something like:
```
A Record: @ ‚Üí 76.76.21.21
CNAME: www ‚Üí cname.vercel-dns.com
```

5. **Go to GoDaddy**
