# AUDIT: PAGES THAT EXIST BUT AREN'T BEING USED

## Created But NOT Linked or Deployed:

### 1. POLICIES PAGE (/01-WEBSITE/policies.html) 
**STATUS**: EXISTS but NOT in main navigation!
- Full policies page with cancellation, booking, payment policies
- Professional layout
- Should be in footer or main nav
- **RECOMMENDATION**: Add to footer with "Policies" link

### 2. SERVICE PAGES (/06-SERVICE-PAGES/)
**STATUS**: Created but NOT in 01-WEBSITE!
- balayage-delray-beach.html - Full SEO-optimized page for balayage service
- color-correction-delray-beach.html - Full page for color correction
- **RECOMMENDATION**: These are SEO gold! Should be moved to 01-WEBSITE and linked

### 3. LOCATION PAGES (/07-LOCATION-PAGES/)
**STATUS**: Created but NOT in 01-WEBSITE!
- delray-beach-hair-salon.html - Location-specific SEO page
- atlantic-avenue-colorist.html - Location-specific page
- **RECOMMENDATION**: Move to 01-WEBSITE for local SEO

### 4. SEO TOOLS (/02-SEO-TOOLS/)
**STATUS**: Created but not linked
- seo-ranking-tracker.html - SEO tracking tool
- automation-hub.html - Automation dashboard
- **RECOMMENDATION**: These might be admin tools - verify if needed

## Currently Active Pages:

### In Main Navigation:
- ✅ Home (index.html)
- ✅ About (#about)
- ✅ Gallery (#gallery)
- ✅ Premium Brands (premiumbrands.html)
- ✅ Reviews (#testimonials)
- ✅ Careers (careers.html)
- ✅ Contact (#contact)

### Hidden/Footer Only:
- ✅ Blog (blog.html) - EXISTS but not in main nav
- ❌ Policies (policies.html) - EXISTS but NOT LINKED ANYWHERE!
- ✅ Admin (admin/login.html) - In footer only

### SEO Microsites (Working):
- ✅ /seo-sites/best-delray-salon/
- ✅ /seo-sites/best-salon-palmbeach/
- ✅ /seo-sites/best-salon-site/

## CRITICAL ISSUES:

1. **Policies page exists but isn't linked** - Customers can't find policies!
2. **Service pages exist but aren't deployed** - Missing SEO opportunity!
3. **Location pages exist but aren't deployed** - Missing local SEO!
4. **Blog exists but isn't in main navigation** - Hidden content!

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:

### Immediate:
1. Add Policies link to footer (at minimum)
2. Add Blog to main navigation

### High Priority:
1. Move service pages to 01-WEBSITE/services/
   - balayage.html
   - color-correction.html
2. Add "Services" dropdown to navigation with these pages

### SEO Priority:
1. Move location pages to 01-WEBSITE/locations/
2. Link from footer for local SEO

## File Structure Issues:
- Pages scattered across multiple directories
- Some SEO-optimized pages not being used
- Confusion about what's deployed vs what exists

## THE TRUTH:
We created a lot of good SEO content that's just sitting there unused!
