# üõ†Ô∏è FOOLPROOF VERCEL SETUP FOR CHRIS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS

### Why Vercel Deployment Might Be Failing:
1. **Wrong Root Directory** - Must point to `01-WEBSITE` folder
2. **Missing index.html** - Vercel looks for index.html, we have enhanced_website.html
3. **Build settings** - Should be "Other" framework, not Next.js

## ‚úÖ THE CORRECT SETUP (Step-by-Step)

### PART 1: Fix the Repository First (YOU DO THIS)

We need to rename the main file so Vercel finds it automatically:

```bash
# In your local directory
cd "/Users/stuartkerr/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/ISO Vision LLC/Chris David Salon/New web site July 25"

# Rename the main website file
mv 01-WEBSITE/enhanced_website.html 01-WEBSITE/index.html

# Update any references
git add -A
git commit -m "Rename main website file to index.html for Vercel compatibility"
git push
```

### PART 2: Chris's Vercel Setup (CHRIS DOES THIS)

#### Step 1: Create Fresh Vercel Account
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. **IMPORTANT**: Choose "Hobby" plan (it's free)
4. Sign up with email (not GitHub yet)

#### Step 2: Connect GitHub to Vercel
1. In Vercel dashboard, click your avatar (top right)
2. Click "Settings"
3. Click "Git Integration" 
4. Click "Connect with GitHub"
5. Authorize Vercel
6. **IMPORTANT**: Select "Only select repositories"
7. Choose "stuinfla/chrisdavidsalon"
8. Click "Install"

#### Step 3: Import the Repository (CRITICAL SETTINGS)
1. Back in Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Add New..." ‚Üí "Project"
3. You should see "stuinfla/chrisdavidsalon" listed
4. Click "Import"

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CONFIGURATION:**
```
Project Name: chris-david-salon
Framework Preset: Other (‚¨ÖÔ∏è IMPORTANT! Not Next.js!)
Root Directory: 01-WEBSITE (‚¨ÖÔ∏è Click Edit and type this)
Build Command: (leave empty)
Output Directory: (leave empty)
Install Command: (leave empty)
```

5. Click "Deploy"
6. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

#### Step 4: Verify It Worked
- You should see "Congratulations!" 
- Click "Visit" button

### PART 3: Connect the Domain (CHRIS DOES THIS)

#### Step 5: Add Domain in Vercel
1. In your project, click "Settings" tab
2. Click "Domains" in left sidebar
3. Type: `chrisdavidsalon.com`
4. Click "Add"

**Vercel will show you something like:**
```
Please configure your domain with these DNS records:

A Record:
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21

CNAME Record:  
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

#### Step 6: Configure GoDaddy DNS
1. Log into GoDaddy.com
2. Click "My Products"
3. Find "chrisdavidsalon.com"
4. Click "DNS" button (NOT "Manage" or "Settings")

**DELETE These Records:**
- Any A records pointing to Squarespace IPs
- Any CNAME records with "squarespace" in them
- Any forwarding rules

**ADD These Records (from Vercel screenshot):**

**A Record:**
- Type: A
- Name: @
- Value: [IP from Vercel, like 76.76.21.21]
- TTL: 600 seconds

**CNAME Record:**
- Type: CNAME  
- Name: www
- Value: [CNAME from Vercel, like cname.vercel-dns.com]
- TTL: 600 seconds

5. Click "Save All Records"

#### Step 7: Remove Any Forwarding
1. Still in GoDaddy
2. Look for "Forwarding" section
3. If ANYTHING is there, delete it
4. We want DNS only, NO forwarding
