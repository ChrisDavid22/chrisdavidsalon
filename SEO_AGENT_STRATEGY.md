- **73% of consumers trust reviews from the last 30 days**

## CONCLUSION

**Weekly monitoring is the optimal frequency** because:
1. Google rankings change constantly but major shifts happen over weeks
2. Review velocity needs weekly tracking (4/week goal)
3. Traffic trends are meaningful week-over-week
4. Cost is essentially $0 with free API tiers
5. Balances actionability with noise reduction

**The agent should focus on:**
1. **Reviews first** - Biggest gap vs competitors (140 vs 1,514)
2. **Technical SEO second** - PageSpeed 58 → 85
3. **Content third** - Service pages, blog content
4. **Authority fourth** - Backlinks and citations

**Total investment: ~$2-5/month in API costs** vs $1,500-5,000/month for an SEO agency doing the same work.
