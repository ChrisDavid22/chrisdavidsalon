      "changes": "INSTANT CACHE FIX: (1) Cache now saves IMMEDIATELY after PageSpeed data loads (not waiting for all APIs). (2) Additional API calls (Content/Local/Authority) now run in PARALLEL using Promise.allSettled. (3) If one API fails, others still complete and cache still saves. This ensures page loads instantly on return visit even if some APIs are slow."

Chris David now shows consistent 91/100 on both pages. (2) MICROSITES PAGE OVERHAUL: Redesigned to show PageRank (working data) as primary focus. Clear action items for fixing unindexed site. GA4 traffic section shows exactly what data becomes available once connected - no more walls of dashes."

(2) COMPETITORS PAGE: Clarified that score is 'Local SEO Score' based on Google Places data (rating + reviews + presence) - different from comprehensive Website SEO Score on SEO Command page."
