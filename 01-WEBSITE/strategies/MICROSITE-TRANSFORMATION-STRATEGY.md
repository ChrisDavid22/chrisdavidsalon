## Final Recommendation

**Start with one site (BestDelrayHairSalon.com) as a pilot**. Build it properly with all 5 pages and quality content. Monitor for 60 days. If successful (positive ROI and no penalties), then expand to the other two sites.

The key is providing GENUINE VALUE to users while naturally positioning Chris David Salon as the premium choice. This approach is defensible, sustainable, and can generate significant long-term SEO value.

**Investment Required**:
- Content creation: $1,500-2,000
- Technical setup: $500-750
- Monthly maintenance: $200-300
- Expected ROI: 400-600% within 6 months

**This transforms simple redirect sites into legitimate local resources that Google will reward rather than penalize.**
