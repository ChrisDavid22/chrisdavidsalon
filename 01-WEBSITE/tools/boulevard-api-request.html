I'm reaching out on behalf of Chris David Salon in Delray Beach, Florida. We're extremely happy with Boulevard as our booking and management platform, and we'd like to expand our integration capabilities to better serve our clients.

Business Information:

We're looking to implement the following enhancements using your API:

1. **Progressive Web App Integration**
   - Real-time availability checking
   - Direct booking from our PWA
   - Push notifications for appointments

2. **Automated Client Engagement**
   - 48-hour appointment reminders
   - Service recommendation based on history
   - Automated rebook reminders

3. **Business Intelligence Dashboard**
   - Revenue attribution tracking
   - Booking pattern analysis

We understand that API access is available for Enterprise customers, and we're interested in:
- Getting our API credentials (Business ID and API Key)
- Access to your Developer Portal (developers.joinblvd.com)
