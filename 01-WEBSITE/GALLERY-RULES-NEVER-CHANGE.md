# ⚠️ CRITICAL GALLERY RULES - NEVER CHANGE ⚠️

## ABSOLUTE RULES FOR THE PHOTO GALLERY

### ❌ NEVER USE LOCAL IMAGES IN GALLERY
- **NO** ./images/ references
- **NO** local file paths
- **NO** generic stock photos
- **NO** images from the images folder

### ✅ ONLY USE GOOGLE BUSINESS PHOTOS
- **ONLY** use URLs from Google Business Profile
- **ONLY** use URLs that start with: https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/
- **ONLY** use actual photos from Chris David Salon's Google Business listing

## ARCHIVED WRONG IMAGES (DO NOT USE)

The following images have been ARCHIVED and must NEVER be used:
- signature.jpg / signature.webp
- signature-correct.jpg / signature-correct.webp  
- signature-service.jpg / signature-service.webp
- salon-hero.jpg / salon-hero.webp
- Backgroundimage.jpg / Backgroundimage.webp

These files are in: `/images/ARCHIVED-DO-NOT-USE/`

## CORRECT SERVICE IMAGES

The service cards (NOT gallery) should use:
- hair-color.jpg/webp (from "11 Hair Color")
- hair-cut.jpg/webp (from "11 Hair Cuts")
- hair-extensions.jpg/webp (from "11 Hair Extensions")
- keratin-treatment.jpg/webp (from "11 Kerati treatments")
- event-styling.jpg/webp (from "11 Styling")

## GALLERY CATEGORIES

The gallery filters by these categories:
- **All**: Shows everything
- **Transformations**: Before/after work
- **Color**: Color services
- **Balayage**: Balayage specifically
- **Cuts**: Haircuts and styling
- **Salon**: Interior shots

## WHY THIS MATTERS

1. Google Business photos are REAL photos of actual work
2. Generic stock photos make the salon look fake
3. The owner wants to showcase ACTUAL work, not stock photos
4. Local images keep getting mixed up and pointing to wrong files

## ENFORCEMENT

If anyone tries to change the gallery to use local images:
1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY**
2. Refer to this document
3. Only use Google Business Profile URLs
4. The gallery warning message must stay visible
