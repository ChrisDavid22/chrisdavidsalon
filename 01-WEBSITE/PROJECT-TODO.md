4. **Documentation** → `/docs/` (technical guides, instructions)
5. **Admin Features** → `/admin/` (dashboards, admin tools)
6. **NEVER dump files in root directory!**
7. **Update SITE-INDEX.md** when adding new files

## How to Use This Document

1. **Check this FIRST** when starting work on admin dashboard
2. **Update checkboxes** as tasks are completed
3. **Add new tasks** as they're discovered
