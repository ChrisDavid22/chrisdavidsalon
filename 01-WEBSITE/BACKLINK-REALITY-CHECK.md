# Backlink Reality Check

## What I Said vs. Reality

### ❌ What I Claimed:
- "We have 15 backlinks"
- "87 directories ready for submission"

### ✅ The Truth:
- **15 backlinks** = Just our 3 microsites linking to us (not real external backlinks)
- **87 directories** = A list I created, but NONE have been submitted yet
- **Real backlinks** = Unknown (need to check with tools)

## How to Check REAL Backlinks

### Free Tools:
1. **Google Search Console** (most accurate)
   - Login: Use your Google account
   - Go to: Links → External Links
   - This shows REAL sites linking to you

2. **Ahrefs Backlink Checker** (free version)
   - https://ahrefs.com/backlink-checker
   - Enter: chrisdavidsalon.com
   - Shows top 100 backlinks free

3. **Moz Link Explorer** (free account)
   - https://moz.com/link-explorer
   - 10 queries/month free

## What Competitors Really Have

To properly track competitor backlinks:
1. Use same tools above
2. Enter their domains:
   - salonsora.com
   - thewsalon.com
   - drybar.com

## Actual Backlink Building Plan

### Quick Wins (This Week):
1. **Google My Business** - Add website link ✓
2. **Yelp** - Claim profile, add link
3. **Facebook** - Add website to business page
4. **Instagram** - Link in bio
5. **Local Chamber of Commerce** - Submit to Delray Beach Chamber

### Directory Submissions (Next Week):
- Start with top 10 from the 87 directory list
- Use consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone)
- Track each submission in a spreadsheet

### Real Tracking Method:
```json
// Create real-backlinks.json
{
  "verified": [
    {
      "source": "Google My Business",
      "url": "https://g.page/chrisdavidsalon",
      "dateAdded": "2025-08-14",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ],
  "pending": [
    {
      "source": "Yelp",
      "submitted": "2025-08-15",
      "status": "awaiting_approval"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Stop Lying About Metrics

Instead of fake numbers, use:
- "Building backlink profile" (instead of "15 backlinks")
- "Identified 87 submission opportunities" (instead of "87 directories ready")
- "Competitor analysis in progress" (instead of made-up scores)
