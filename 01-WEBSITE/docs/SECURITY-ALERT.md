# ðŸš¨ SECURITY ALERT: API KEYS COMPROMISED

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Your API keys have been exposed publicly and MUST be revoked immediately!

### Compromised Keys (REVOKE NOW):
1. **OpenAI Keys** (2 keys starting with sk-proj and sk-svcacct)
2. **Claude API Keys** (2 keys starting with sk-ant)
3. **Google Gemini Key** (AIzaSy...)
4. **Groq Key** (gsk_...)
5. **Together AI Key**
6. **Grok/xAI Key**

### Steps to Fix:

#### 1. REVOKE ALL KEYS IMMEDIATELY:
- OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Anthropic Claude: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
- Google Cloud: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
- Groq: https://console.groq.com/keys

#### 2. Check for Unauthorized Usage:
- Check your billing pages for unusual charges
- Look for unexpected API calls

#### 3. Generate NEW Keys:
- Create new API keys after revoking old ones
- Use different keys this time

#### 4. Store Keys SAFELY:
```bash
# Create a .env file (NEVER commit this!)
touch .env

# Add your NEW keys to .env
echo "CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-new-key-here" >> .env
```

#### 5. NEVER Share Keys Again:
- Don't paste them in chat messages
- Don't commit them to GitHub
- Don't email them
- Don't put them in documentation

### For Your Website:

The admin dashboard can use API keys, but they should be:
1. Stored in browser localStorage (not in code)
2. Entered through the API Settings interface
3. Never visible in the source code

### Estimated Risk:
- Someone could use your keys to make API calls
- This could cost you money on your accounts
- Revoke them NOW to prevent charges

### Safe Key Storage for Website:

Since this is a static website, you have two options:

1. **Browser Storage** (Current Implementation):
   - Enter keys in the admin dashboard
   - They're stored in your browser only
   - Never sent to any server

2. **Backend Server** (Future):
   - Set up a simple backend
   - Store keys on server
   - Make API calls from server

## THIS IS URGENT - REVOKE THOSE KEYS NOW!
