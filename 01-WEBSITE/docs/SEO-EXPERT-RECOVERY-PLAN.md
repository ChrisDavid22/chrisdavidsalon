# SEO EXPERT RECOVERY PLAN - CHRIS DAVID SALON
**Date: August 11, 2025**
**Status: CRITICAL - Multiple SEO Failures Requiring Immediate Fix**

---

## THE REAL PROBLEM (What I Should Have Caught)

1. **Domain Canonicalization Failure**
   - Site uses www.chrisdavidsalon.com as primary (307 redirect from non-www)
   - All internal references were pointing to non-www version
   - Google sees these as DIFFERENT sites
   - This explains the indexing failures

2. **Google Search Console Configuration Error**
   - Property is verified but likely for the wrong version
   - Need BOTH versions in Search Console with preferred domain set
   - Current 4 indexed pages are probably from old non-www property

3. **Technical SEO Failures**
   - No robots.txt on production (404 error)
   - Sitemap had wrong URLs (non-www)
   - Canonical tags pointed to wrong domain version
   - No structured data markup
   - No Google Analytics

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN (IN THIS EXACT ORDER)

### STEP 1: Fix Search Console Setup (TODAY)
1. **Add BOTH properties to Search Console:**
   - https://www.chrisdavidsalon.com (primary)
   - https://chrisdavidsalon.com (for redirect tracking)

2. **Submit corrected sitemap to www version:**
   - Go to www property → Sitemaps → Add: sitemap.xml
   - This sitemap now has correct www URLs (just fixed)

3. **Use URL Inspection Tool:**
   - Inspect: https://www.chrisdavidsalon.com
   - Click "Request indexing"
   - Repeat for all main pages

### STEP 2: Technical Fixes (COMPLETE)
✅ Canonical tags - FIXED (all point to www)
✅ Sitemap URLs - FIXED (all use www)
✅ Meta tags - FIXED (og:url and twitter:url use www)
⏳ Robots.txt - Pushed but needs verification

### STEP 3: Force Google Reindexing (TODAY-TOMORROW)
1. **Priority Pages to Submit:**
   - https://www.chrisdavidsalon.com/
   - https://www.chrisdavidsalon.com/premiumbrands.html
   - https://www.chrisdavidsalon.com/policies.html

2. **Use Google's Indexing API** (faster than waiting):
   - Set up API access
   - Submit URLs programmatically
   - Gets indexed in hours vs days

### STEP 4: Backlink Audit (THIS WEEK)
1. **Check existing backlinks:**
   - Many probably point to non-www version
   - Need 301 redirect verification
   - Update high-value links if possible

2. **Build new citations with correct URL:**
   - Google My Business: Update website URL to www version
   - Yelp, Facebook, Instagram: Update all to www
   - Local directories: Ensure consistency

### STEP 5: Monitor & Iterate (NEXT 30 DAYS)
1. **Week 1:** Daily Search Console checks
2. **Week 2:** Ranking improvements should start
3. **Week 3:** Traffic increase expected
4. **Week 4:** Full indexing complete

## WHY THIS HAPPENED (My Failures)

1. **Didn't check redirect behavior first** - Should have used curl immediately
2. **Assumed non-www was canonical** - Amateur mistake
3. **Didn't verify Search Console property version** - Critical oversight
4. **Wasted time on wrong domain variant** - 40+ minutes lost

---

## EXPECTED RESULTS

### Within 48 Hours:
- Robots.txt accessible
- New pages starting to index
- Search Console showing improvement

### Within 1 Week:
- 10+ pages indexed
- Rankings improving for brand terms
- Organic traffic increasing

### Within 1 Month:
- Full site indexed
- Local pack appearances
- Microsites supporting main site

---

## MICROSITE STRATEGY (AFTER MAIN SITE FIXED)

### Correct Setup Order:
1. Fix main site COMPLETELY first
2. Then add microsites to Search Console
3. Build quality backlinks to microsites
4. Microsites link to www.chrisdavidsalon.com (not non-www)

### Expected Timeline:
- Month 1: Main site recovery
- Month 2: Microsite indexing
- Month 3: Ranking improvements
- Month 4-6: Dominating local search

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS

```bash
# Check redirect is working
curl -I https://chrisdavidsalon.com
# Should show: location: https://www.chrisdavidsalon.com/

# Check robots.txt
curl https://www.chrisdavidsalon.com/robots.txt
# Should return the file content

# Check sitemap
curl https://www.chrisdavidsalon.com/sitemap.xml | grep "<loc>"
# All URLs should include www
```

## YOUR IMMEDIATE TODO:

1. ✅ Go to Search Console
2. ✅ Make sure you're in the www.chrisdavidsalon.com property
3. ✅ Submit sitemap.xml
4. ✅ Request indexing for homepage
5. ✅ Screenshot any errors and send them

This is the CORRECT expert approach. No more amateur mistakes.
