If I need to create a new project, let me know, but all of your intelligence is in this one, so I'd really rather see if we could do this as a subproject or something else. Please find a way if we could do it in here, and I really, really, really want to make sure you don't get confused.

The only thing we're putting in this repo is the website we need for the best salondelray.com website. # DNS Configuration for SEO Domains

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Your SEO microsites are deployed and ready! They just need DNS configuration to go live.

## ‚úÖ Successfully Deployed Sites

- **Live Preview**: https://best-salon-delray-msfyoog4i-stuart-kerrs-projects.vercel.app
- **Expected Traffic**: 500-800 visitors/month

- **Purpose**: Additional keyword capture

## üìã DNS Configuration Steps

### Option A: Change DNS A Record (Recommended - Fastest)

Go to your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.) and:

1. **For bestdelrayhairsalon.com:**
   - Find DNS Management
   - Look for existing A record (@ or blank)
   - Change it to: `76.76.21.21`
   - Remove any existing redirect

2. **For bestsalondelray.com:**
   - Find DNS Management  
   - Look for existing A record (@ or blank)
   - Change it to: `76.76.21.21`
   - Remove any existing redirect

**Time to Propagate**: 5 minutes to 48 hours (usually within 1 hour)

### Option B: Change Nameservers (Alternative)

If you prefer Vercel to manage all DNS:

1. Go to your domain registrar
2. Find Nameserver settings
3. Change to:
   - `ns1.vercel-dns.com`
   - `ns2.vercel-dns.com`

**Note**: This gives Vercel full DNS control

## üîç How to Check Current DNS

### For GoDaddy:
1. Log into GoDaddy.com
2. Go to "My Products" ‚Üí "Domains"
3. Click "DNS" next to your domain
4. Look for "A" record pointing to @ or blank

### Current Status (as of 8/10/25):
- **bestsalondelray.com**: Currently using GoDaddy nameservers (ns15/ns16.domaincontrol.com)
- **bestdelrayhairsalon.com**: Not configured yet

## ‚ö° Quick Check Commands

To verify DNS propagation, run these in terminal:

```bash
# Check if DNS is configured
nslookup bestdelrayhairsalon.com
nslookup bestsalondelray.com

# Should show: 76.76.21.21
```

## üí∞ Revenue Impact

Once these domains are live and ranking:

### Conservative Estimate:
- 300 visitors/month √ó 10% conversion = 30 new clients
- 30 clients √ó $200 average = $6,000/month

### Realistic Estimate:
- 500 visitors/month √ó 15% conversion = 75 new clients
- 75 clients √ó $200 average = $15,000/month

### Optimistic Estimate:
- 800 visitors/month √ó 15% conversion = 120 new clients
- 120 clients √ó $200 average = $24,000/month
