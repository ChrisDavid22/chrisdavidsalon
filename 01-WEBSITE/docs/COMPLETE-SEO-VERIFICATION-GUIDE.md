## PART 3: COMPLETE SETUP CHECKLIST

### FOR MAIN SITE (www.chrisdavidsalon.com) - PRIORITY 1

#### ‚úÖ Already Done:
- [x] Site is live on Vercel
- [x] Sitemap exists and is accessible
- [x] Site redirects from non-www to www

#### üî¥ Chris Must Do NOW:
1. [ ] **Add Property in Search Console**
   - Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
   - Click "Add property"
   - Choose "URL prefix"
   - Enter: `https://www.chrisdavidsalon.com`
   - **NOT** chrisdavidsalon.com (no www)

2. [ ] **Verify Ownership** (see Part 2 above)

3. [ ] **Submit Sitemap**
   - After verification, go to "Sitemaps" in left menu
   - Enter: `sitemap.xml`
   - Click "Submit"

4. [ ] **Check Indexing Issues**
   - Go to "Pages" in left menu (NOT "Coverage" - that's old)
   - Look for any errors or warnings
   - Share screenshot with Stuart

5. [ ] **Request Indexing**
   - Go to URL Inspection tool (top bar)
   - Enter: `https://www.chrisdavidsalon.com`
   - Click "Request Indexing"

#### üî¥ Stuart Must Do:
1. [ ] Push robots.txt file (currently missing on live site)
2. [ ] Add Google Analytics code once Chris provides it
3. [ ] Add verification meta tag if Chris chooses that method

---

### FOR SEO MICROSITES - PRIORITY 2

Do these AFTER main site is working:

#### For Each Site (bestsalondelray.com, bestdelraysalon.com, bestsalonpalmbeach.com):

1. [ ] **Add to Search Console**
   - Add as URL prefix property
   - Use the www version if it redirects

2. [ ] **Verify Ownership**
   - Same methods as main site

3. [ ] **Submit Sitemap**
   - Each site has its own sitemap.xml

4. [ ] **Add Analytics**
   - Use same Google Analytics property
   - Different views for each domain

---

## PART 4: WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

### Week 1 (After Setup):
- ‚úÖ All properties verified in Search Console
- ‚úÖ Sitemaps submitted and processing
- ‚úÖ Indexing requests submitted
- ‚úÖ Google Analytics tracking visitors

### Week 2-4:
- Pages start appearing in Google index
- Search Console shows impressions
- Analytics shows organic traffic

### Month 2-3:
- Rankings improve for target keywords
- Microsites appear in local searches
- Increased phone calls and bookings

---

## PART 5: EMERGENCY FIXES NEEDED

### üö® Fix #1: Missing Robots.txt
The robots.txt file exists locally but is NOT on the live site. This needs immediate deployment.

### üö® Fix #2: Zero Indexed Pages
The main site has been live since August 9 but has 0 pages in Google. This suggests:
- Either no sitemap was ever submitted
- Or there's a blocking issue preventing indexing
- Or the site was never verified in Search Console

### üö® Fix #3: Search Console Setup
We discovered the property might be set up for the wrong domain (non-www vs www). This MUST be corrected.

## CONTACT FOR ISSUES

If Chris encounters any issues:
